# Overlord
An adaptable mission framework for Arma 3.

The overarching idea is to break down the map into 'Hexes' which we can then use extensively for things like drawing battlelines, Ai decisions, resources, etc etc.

This mission is being designed with adaptability in mind meaning that it could be quickly and efficently transfered from one map to another.  Settings will also be available to provide different atmospheres to the mission based on the host's will.

## Goals include:
* Configurability... my preferences are not the same as others
* Adaptability... make core presentation code easily accessible to allow changes in things like 'tasks', 'factions', or 'plugins'.
* Scalablility... ensure Ai decisions are sufficent enough to make fluid and intersting gameplay that is augmented instead of dependent on the number of humans.
* Immersive... realism can be skimped on in favor of gameplay but it should still attempt to invest the player in the world created.  This means detailed visuals and intuitive mechanics.
