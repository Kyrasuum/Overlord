v.1.8
-Fixed: commander stuck watching the same direction forever after been given doTarget order.
-Fixed: 'lazy' target switching. Will now immediately switch to more valueable target.
-Fixed: setup.sqf non starting for vehicles with non-standard names (modded). Should work for any vehicle that has weapons (list of weapons is still hardcoded though).
-Fixed: small fixes here and there.
-Added: vehicle commander (or gunner, if no commander) will 'scan the horizon' for targets when idle. Commander will use his optics independantly of gunner's main turret.

v.1.7
-Hardcoded unit classes replaced with dynamic threat assessment based on available weapons: both target and our vehicle (a 'sniper' infantry class that has aquired AT launcher will be given threat value as an AT rifleman). Should now work with modded vehicles with non-standard names, as long as they belong to standard base classes (Man, Car, Tank etc) and use standard weapons names.
-Tanks will fire HE rounds at helicopters.
-Added signature.

v.1.6
-Fixed multiplayer bugs (locality shifts)
-Small bugfixes

v.1.5
-Various fixes to targeting algorithm.
-Tanks load appropriate rounds for different target types.

v.1.4
Distributed in a form of addon now.

v.1.3
Smart behaviour is now determined by the commander's combat mode, not driver's. This way tank's driver can be set to RELAXED (to stick to roads
while moving) without disabling hull rotatation and target aquisition.

v.1.2
-Fixed: doesn't require human player in faction any more for the script to work.

v.1.1
-Added compatibility with High Command.
-Small fixes

v.1.0
-Initial release.
